Recovery Time Objective (RTO)

In the event there is an outage of services for a single AZ the minimum RTO would be approximately 1 hour
from the time the problem occurs to remediation of the problem. Because the services are replicated in another region
to serve as backup or redundancy, the minimum RTO for a single region outage would be 1 hour, the same as a single
AZ outage.

Recovery Point Objective (RPO)

For the minimum RPO, 30 minutes would be needed to allow enough time to detect the problem, gather enough staff
to address the problem and start the restoration process. Because we only have one AZ per region, the minimum RPO
still be 30 minutes to detect the problem, address the problem and start to restore the system.
